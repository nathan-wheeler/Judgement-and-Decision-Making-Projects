# Judgement-and-Decision-Making-Projects
This repository documents code for my academic research projects on how everyday incentives can lead preference for biased information.

## Biased Information Preference Simulation
Formally models and simulates three plausible models of incentive-based preferences for biased information. Specifically, biased information preferences can result from congeniality bias, from being overly biased to seek trustworthy information, and even from strictly rational attempts to minimize large mistakes for acting on incorrect beliefs. 

## Moderately Biased Information Preference
Constructs a model of experimental data that demonstrates that people show incentive-based preferences for moderately biased information. In particular, large possible rewards for acting on correct beliefs lead them to prefer optimistic information more than otherwise, while large possible losses for acting on incorrect beliefs lead them to prefer pessimistic information more than otherwise. 

## Extremely Biased Information Preference 1 & 2
In two additional datasets, constructs additional models that demonstrate that people will even show incentive-based preferences for extremely biased information. In particular, large possible rewards can lead people to prefer even extremely optimistic information more, while large possible losses can lead people to prefer even extremely pessimistic information more. 

## Variation in Biased Information Preference
Using model comparison and simultaneous regression, demonstrates that there is substational variation in individual preference for biased information. Further demonstrates variation in the models that best explain individual preferences for biased information, with some people prefering biased informaiton only when doing so rationally maximizes thier ability to gain rewards and avoid losses, while others prefer biased information as a result of being prone to seek trustworthy sources, and still others prefer biased information that is congenial with thier prior beliefs.
